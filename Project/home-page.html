        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hello there! Welcome to Australia! My name is Harley! People call me the Pokémon Travel Prof!
            This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! For some people, Pokémon are pets. Other use
            them for fights. Myself… I use pokemon to assist others in their travels.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Australia</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This magical place the world calls Australia is home many wonderful creatures and breathtaking
            scenery all throughout. It is my job as a Travel professor to make sure you enjoy your stay.
            Thank you for agreeing to help me with my research into the wildlife species we may find. As you're aware,
            Australia is a vast land with many different aspects and sceneries to enjoy. On this research trip we will
            be focusing on Sydney.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> Sydney</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Sydney spans from coastline to inner country farmlands, we will be mostly active within the coastline for
            this trip. Please be sure to
            mark down any and all encounters with pokemon and the native wildlife you may find around.
        </p>
