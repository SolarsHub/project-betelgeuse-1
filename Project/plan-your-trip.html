        <h3>Our expedition begins from in the City Center, as this is a collaborative effort
            with the team from WooliesX our Journey begins at their office. Please keep in mind that we will be among
            the first to explore this new
            region. Therefore, we will not have a comprehensive list on what we should expect when it comes to Pokemon
            in the areas. I've included a little information
            we've managed to gather but be diligent in your ecological survey so that we may accurately mark the
            locations and nests in the areas.</h3>

                        <p>Bus
                            If you’re travelling from the city to Bondi Beach, the bus often runs from Circular Quay and
                            will take approximately 45
                            minutes. This bus is usually the 380 or 333 bus, and is close to ferry wharf number 2
                            (opposite
                            the AMP buildings and
                            Customs House).

                        <br>
                        <p>Train
                            If you prefer to catch the train, the stops from Central Station run through Central, Town
                            Hall,
                            Martin Place, Kings
                            Cross, Edgecliff and then Bondi Junction. From Bondi Junction station, you can then catch
                            the
                            380, 381, 382 or 333 bus
                            which will take you to Bondi Beach.

                            Bike
                            Although it may not be a traditional method of transport in and around Sydney, biking may be
                            a
                            great option for those
                            looking for a physical activity to take them where they need to go. And you’ll get to see
                            some
                            great Sydney sights along
                            the way. There are a number of different routes and roads to choose to get from the city to
                            Bondi Beach, so check out a
                            map and take a look to see if you can find a route that suits you best.

                        <p>Go swimming:
                            It may seem obvious, but one of the best things to do when visiting Bondi Beach is to take a
                            swim at this famous
                            location. Always be sure to swim between the red and yellow flags and follow the
                            instructions of the lifeguards on duty.
                            That way, you can ensure you will have a fun yet safe time in the surf.

                        <p>
                            Go surfing:
                            Whether you are a seasoned professional or just want to get started, surfing is a great
                            Australian pastime that should
                            definitely be tried out at Bondi Beach. You may want to consider bodyboarding if you have
                            never surfed before (or don’t
                            feel very confident in trying), or you can try surfing by trying out surfing lessons held on
                            the beach.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sunbathing:
                            Sunbathing is a great way to relax, enjoy the beach and soak in the sun’s rays. However, as
                            the sun can be quite harsh
                            in Australia it’s always advised to use as much sunscreen protection as possible and cover
                            up where necessary. Never go
                            out of your way to get sunburned, as this puts you at greater risk of skin cancers. But,
                            with the right sun protection,
                            you can still enjoy a relaxing session in the sun.

                            Take a walk:
                            It may seem like a silly suggestion, but it’s actually a great way to get oriented at this
                            location, see the sights and
                            see what the area has to offer. Whether it’s along the beach or along the main strip beside
                            the beach, you’ll be able to
                            see what can be discovered at Bondi Beach, simply by taking a walk. It might take around
                            half an hour to get acquainted
                            with the general area, so you’ll then have a better idea of how you will want to spend your
                            day at Bondi.

                            The area is famous for its expensive stores, so it is recommended to equip your Pokémon with

                        The Botanical Gardens is a vibrant and beautiful area filled with daily activities changing each
                        day. If you want to know
                        what you can do while you're there, it's better to just show up. They have performances, shows,
                        art exibits as well as tours.

                        <p>Botanical Gardens is a haven for relaxed and unaggresive Pokémon. Many people come here to
                            get rid of their stress by
                            smelling the Sweet Scent used by the abdundant Grass-Type Pokémon. Many say that the Cherrim
                            blossoming everyday is a
